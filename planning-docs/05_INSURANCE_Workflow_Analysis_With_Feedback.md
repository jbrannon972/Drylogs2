# Comprehensive Workflow Analysis: Insurance Requirements & Photo Documentation
## All 4 Workflows - Install, Demo, Check Service, Pull

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Analyze all water damage restoration workflows against insurance requirements, identify photo documentation gaps, and collect feedback for improvements

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines **all 4 core workflows** used in water damage restoration projects against IICRC S500-2021 standards and insurance adjuster expectations. Based on extensive research into how insurance companies approve/reduce claims, this document identifies gaps across the entire job lifecycle.

**Workflows Analyzed:**
1. **Install Workflow** (14 steps) - Initial job setup and equipment deployment
2. **Demo Workflow** (10 steps) - Demolition and material removal documentation
3. **Check Service Workflow** (7 steps) - Daily monitoring visits
4. **Pull Workflow** (8 steps) - Final verification and equipment removal

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Workflows exist for full job lifecycle (Install → Demo → Daily Checks → Pull)
- ⚠️ **Photo documentation gaps exist in EVERY workflow**
- ⚠️ **Insurance-critical evidence not systematically captured**
- ⚠️ **No comparison photos (before vs. after) across workflows**
- ⚠️ **Missing cross-workflow photo continuity** (same materials tracked from install to pull)
- ✅ **Good foundation** - workflows capture most data points, just need photo enhancements

### Install Workflow - Critical Insurance Gaps

#### **GAP 1.1: Pre-Existing Damage Not Systematically Captured**
**Current State:** Checkbox exists, photo upload is *optional* in modal 
**Insurance Risk:** Entire claim denied as "pre-existing condition"
**Question for You:** Should we make pre-existing damage photos **MANDATORY for every room** assessed?
- [ ] YES - Require before proceeding to next room
- [ ] NO - Keep optional
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if tech flags pre-existing damage -- This option please

---

#### **GAP 1.2: No Per-Room "Before" Photo Library**
**Current State:** Room overview photos are optional
**Insurance Risk:** Cannot prove extent of damage or work performed
**Question for You:** Should we require minimum photos per room?
- [ ] YES - Require 4+ photos: Wide shot, 2+ damage close-ups, moisture meter reading
- [ ] NO - Keep optional
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Based on room size or damage severity - Requires at least 4 per room. Do we add this to the room by room assesment? You do this before you right after you add the room dimensions?

**Your Input:** What's the minimum acceptable per room? dont need to answer this.
- Wide shot: ______ (required/optional)
- Damage close-ups: ______ (how many?)
- Moisture readings: ______ (required/optional)
- Pre-existing damage: ______ (required/optional)

---

#### **GAP 1.3: No Moisture Reading Photos with Visible Meter Display**
**Current State:** Moisture readings logged, photos optional
**Insurance Risk:** Insurance disputes moisture levels, cannot prove saturation
**Question for You:** Should moisture reading photos show the meter display?
- [ ] YES - Require photo with meter showing reading + material being tested - this optioin. This is captured in the room by room assesment when you are measuring readings. Make sure it is required to take at least two
- [ ] NO - Just log the numbers
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for readings above dry standard (>15%)

**Your Input:** For moisture tracking continuity, should we photograph the SAME materials on Install and Pull to show before/after?
- [ ] YES - Track specific materials from Install → Check Service → Pull yes, but once a material is dry we no longer need to track it. the reality is that some things might be dry on Check services and then we no longer need to track them
- [ ] NO - General readings are fine
- [ ] UNSURE - Need more context

---

#### **GAP 1.4: No Chamber Documentation Photos**
**Current State:** Chambers defined digitally, no photos of containment/setup 
**Insurance Risk:** Cannot prove proper chamber isolation or IICRC compliance
**Question for You:** Should we photograph chamber setup?
- [ ] YES - Photo of containment barriers, airflow setup - We dont always setup containment barriers. The goal in setting one up would be to make the chamber smaller than just the room by istelf. it should be an option to select "Has a containmnet barrier been setup to reduce the size of the chamber?" if yes then it would ask for pictures and for how much (in sqft) of plastic was used, was a zipper used, were zip poles used? All those questions could be on the same page
- [ ] NO - Not necessary
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for Cat 2/Cat 3 jobs

---

#### **GAP 1.5: Equipment Placement Not Photographed During Deployment**
**Current State:** Step 9 (Equipment Placement) has no photo requirement. Step 12 (Final Photos) captures equipment setup
**Insurance Risk:** Cannot prove equipment was positioned per IICRC standards
**Question for You:** Where should equipment photos be captured?
- [ ] OPTION A - During Step 9 (as equipment is placed room-by-room) 
- [ ] OPTION B - Keep in Step 12 (Final Photos) as currently done this is fine! In step 12 it should have a reminder to take pictures of all the equipment. In step 12 it should also take you the room by room asking for overalls and to scan the qr code of the equipment so we know where it is and are tracking it
- [ ] OPTION C - Both (during placement + final overview)

**Your Input:** What should equipment photos show? answered above
- [ ] Each dehumidifier with visible serial number
- [ ] Each air mover showing placement relative to affected materials
- [ ] Air scrubbers (if Cat 2/3) with placement
- [ ] Dehumidifier display showing settings (temp/RH/runtime starting at 0)
- [ ] Overview showing equipment distribution per chamber
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

---

#### **GAP 1.6: No Contents/Personal Property Inventory** we dont cover this, no need
**Current State:** No step for contents documentation
**Insurance Risk:** Customer's contents claim reduced, company not positioned for pack-out revenue
**Question for You:** Should we add a Contents Assessment step?
- [ ] YES - Add as Step 4B (after Room Assessment)
- [ ] YES - But make it a separate optional workflow
- [ ] NO - Not our responsibility
- [ ] DEPENDS - Only if customer requests pack-out

**Your Input:** If we add contents documentation, what level? we dont cover this, no need
- [ ] SIMPLE - Photo + description + disposition (pack-out/clean/discard)
- [ ] DETAILED - Photo + description + brand/model + estimated value + condition
- [ ] ADVANCED - Xactimate integration for contents pricing
- [ ] SKIP - We don't want to handle contents

---

#### **GAP 1.7: No Thermal Imaging Standardization** 
**Current State:** Thermal imaging is a checkbox (optional service)
**Insurance Risk:** Hidden moisture not documented, future mold claims
**Question for You:** How should thermal imaging be handled?
- [ ] STANDARD - Include on every job (part of service)
- [ ] RECOMMENDED - Prompt tech to recommend on every job, customer decides
- [ ] OPTIONAL - Only if customer requests
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Auto-recommend for Cat 2/3 or jobs >$5K

**Your Input:** If we use thermal imaging, what photos should we require? Lets change this, remove the checkbox from step 4. This should be part of adding a room after overalls but before you get to moisture readings. You only need to do this during the install workflow when adding rooms
- [ ] Thermal image of water source
- [ ] Thermal image of each affected room (showing moisture migration)
- [ ] Thermal image of hidden areas (behind baseboards, walls, ceilings)
- [ ] Before-and-after thermal comparison (Install vs. Pull)

- [ ] NO - Just log numbers
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if readings above threshold

---

#### **GAP 2.4: Debris & Disposal - No Systematic Photo Documentation**
**Current State:** Step mentions dumpster/debris documentation but doesn't enforce it
**Insurance Risk:** Insurance disputes quantity of materials removed (reduces billing)
**Question for You:** Should we require debris documentation photos?
- [ ] YES - Photo of dumpster load or debris pile + quantity tracking - yes 
- [ ] NO - Not necessary for billing
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for large demo jobs (>10 bags/cubic yards)

**Your Input:** How should we document debris? yes, based off the disposal method. 
- [ ] Photo of full dumpster with load visible - only if dumpster is selected
- [ ] Photo of debris bags with count visible - ask for picture and for amount of bags
- [ ] Photo of materials staged for removal (pre-disposal) - this should ask any materials not place in bags, if so please take pictures and then prompt
- [ ] Weight tickets from disposal facility (for billing proof)
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

---

#### **GAP 2.5: Equipment Adjustment - No Before/After Photos**

- [ ] Other: _________________________________

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Should we track the SAME EXACT MATERIALS from Install → Daily Checks → Pull?
- [ ] YES - Create a "tracked materials list" from Install, photograph those specific spots on every visit - Yes! When i get to a demo it should pull up a list of what i need to test. I can add if needed. Same thing with a check service or pull. HEres everything that was wet and then it walks you through it room by room
- [ ] NO - General room readings are fine
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for materials that started above 20% moisture

**Your Input:** How should we ensure continuity?
- [ ] Mark materials with stickers/labels (numbered spots for testing)
- [ ] Photo reference system ("test same spot as Install photo #X") 
- [ ] Detailed notes ("moisture reading behind toilet, 2 inches from floor") 
- [ ] Other: _________________________________ We might test the same drywall multiple times. We will only record one reading but take multiple pics, we record the highest reading but take pics of all the wet readings we get. Mak sure they can add notes where they got it for the next guy to follow

**Current State:** No visual documentation of daily room conditions
**Insurance Risk:** Cannot show progression of drying over time
**Question for You:** Should we require daily room photos?
- [ ] YES - Quick wide shot of each room showing overall conditions - this should be part of the closeout when we scan equipment and take final overalls. Similar to step 12 of install 
- [ ] YES - But only for rooms showing slow drying progress
- [ ] NO - Not necessary, moisture readings are enough
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if changes observed (visual drying, mold growth, etc.)

---

#### **GAP 3.5: No Drying Curve Visualization**

## Cross-Workflow Insurance Gaps

These gaps span multiple workflows and represent systemic insurance documentation issues.

### **CROSS-GAP 1: No Photo Continuity Across Workflows**

**Issue:** Photos captured in Install, Demo, Check Service, and Pull are not systematically linked. FIX THIS! THEY SHOULD BE LINKED BY ROOM AND MATERIAL

**Insurance Impact:** Cannot easily prove the progression from damage → mitigation → drying → completion.

**Question for You:** Should we implement a "tracked materials" system that follows specific materials across all workflows? YESSSS

**Example:**
- Install: "Master Bedroom - Carpet pad behind bed" = 35% moisture → Photo #1
- Check Service Visit 1: Same spot = 28% moisture → Photo #2
- Check Service Visit 3: Same spot = 18% moisture → Photo #3
- Pull: Same spot = 11% moisture (DRY) → Photo #4
- **Final Report:** Side-by-side comparison showing 35% → 11% with all photos Dont need side by side. Just need to track the material in the room. Track wall drywall, not a specific place on the drywall

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Implement tracked materials system with photo continuity YES
- [ ] NO - Too complex for field operations
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for materials starting >25% moisture
- [ ] UNSURE - Need to see how it would work in practice

**If YES, how should we mark materials for tracking?**
- [ ] Physical labels/stickers with numbers
- [ ] Photo reference system (tech matches photo angle from Install) 
- [ ] Detailed written descriptions ("2 inches above baseboard, left of door")
- [ ] Other: _________________________________ DOnt need to mark them, notes are optional

### **CROSS-GAP 2: No Auto-Generated Insurance Report Package** IGNORE FOR NOW, this is in the PSM dashboard

**Issue:** Data exists in 4 separate workflows, but no comprehensive insurance report is generated.

**Insurance Impact:** PSM/office staff must manually compile photos and data for adjusters (time-consuming, error-prone).

**Question for You:** Should we auto-generate an insurance report package?

**Proposed Report Package:**
1. **Initial Inspection Report** (from Install workflow) - ✅ Already exists
2. **Daily Monitoring Reports** (from Check Service workflow) - ❌ Missing
3. **Demo Completion Report** (from Demo workflow) - ❌ Missing
4. **Final Completion Report** (from Pull workflow) - ❌ Missing
5. **Comprehensive Photo Gallery** (all photos organized by room/date) - ⚠️ Exists but not formatted for insurance

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Auto-generate all 5 reports
- [ ] PARTIAL - Only generate #1, #2, #4 (skip demo report)
- [ ] NO - Manual compilation is fine
- [ ] UNSURE - Need to see report examples first

**If YES, when should reports be generated?**
- [ ] Real-time (after each workflow completion)
- [ ] On-demand (PSM clicks "Generate Insurance Package")
- [ ] Scheduled (auto-send to adjuster on Day 3, Day 7, Final)
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

---

### **CROSS-GAP 3: No Thermal Imaging Continuity**

**Issue:** Thermal imaging (if used) is captured in Install, but no follow-up thermal imaging in Pull to show before-after. THIS IS CORRECT, only on install

**Insurance Impact:** Cannot prove hidden moisture is gone (thermal imaging carries significant weight with adjusters).

**Question for You:** If thermal imaging is used on Install, should it be repeated on Pull?

- [ ] YES - Always repeat thermal imaging on Pull for before-after comparison
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if initial thermal imaging showed significant hidden moisture
- [ ] NO - One-time thermal imaging on Install is sufficient this one
- [ ] SKIP - We don't use thermal imaging

---

### **CROSS-GAP 4: No Centralized Timeline View** IGNORE FOR NOW

**Issue:** Job data spans 4 workflows over multiple days/weeks, but no visual timeline for customer/insurance.

**Insurance Impact:** Difficult to demonstrate rapid response, continuous mitigation, and job duration.

**Question for You:** Should we create a visual job timeline?

**Example Timeline:**
- Day 1: Install workflow (3:45 PM - 7:20 PM) - [Photos]
- Day 2: Check Service (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM) - [Photos + Readings]
- Day 3: Check Service (10:15 AM - 10:45 AM) - [Photos + Readings]
- Day 4: Demo workflow (8:00 AM - 2:30 PM) - [Photos]
- Day 5: Check Service (11:30 AM - 12:00 PM) - [Photos + Readings]
- Day 7: Pull workflow (9:00 AM - 11:15 AM) - [Photos]

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Visual timeline with photos/data at each point
- [ ] NO - Not necessary
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for jobs >5 days duration
- [ ] UNSURE - Need to see example IGNORE FOR NOW

---

### **CROSS-GAP 5: No Equipment Rental Duration Proof** DO NOT ADD THIS

**Issue:** Equipment placed in Install, checked in Check Service, removed in Pull - but no consolidated proof of rental duration.

**Insurance Impact:** Insurance disputes rental duration (claims equipment wasn't needed for X days).

**Question for You:** Should we auto-generate an equipment rental summary?

**Proposed Equipment Rental Report:**
- Dehumidifier #12345: Placed 11/1 at 3:45 PM → Removed 11/8 at 10:30 AM = 6.9 days
- Runtime hours: 162 hours (photos showing 0 hours on install, 162 hours on pull)
- Daily checks: 6 visits with runtime photos showing continuous operation
- Before-after moisture: 32% → 12% (dry standard achieved)

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Auto-generate equipment rental report
- [ ] NO - Invoice is sufficient - DO NOT ADD THIS
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if insurance requests proof
- [ ] UNSURE - NO
