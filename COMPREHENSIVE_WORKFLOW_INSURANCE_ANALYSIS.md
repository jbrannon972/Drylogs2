# Comprehensive Workflow Analysis: Insurance Requirements & Photo Documentation
## All 4 Workflows - Install, Demo, Check Service, Pull

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Analyze all water damage restoration workflows against insurance requirements, identify photo documentation gaps, and collect feedback for improvements

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines **all 4 core workflows** used in water damage restoration projects against IICRC S500-2021 standards and insurance adjuster expectations. Based on extensive research into how insurance companies approve/reduce claims, this document identifies gaps across the entire job lifecycle.

**Workflows Analyzed:**
1. **Install Workflow** (14 steps) - Initial job setup and equipment deployment
2. **Demo Workflow** (10 steps) - Demolition and material removal documentation
3. **Check Service Workflow** (7 steps) - Daily monitoring visits
4. **Pull Workflow** (8 steps) - Final verification and equipment removal

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Workflows exist for full job lifecycle (Install → Demo → Daily Checks → Pull)
- ⚠️ **Photo documentation gaps exist in EVERY workflow**
- ⚠️ **Insurance-critical evidence not systematically captured**
- ⚠️ **No comparison photos (before vs. after) across workflows**
- ⚠️ **Missing cross-workflow photo continuity** (same materials tracked from install to pull)
- ✅ **Good foundation** - workflows capture most data points, just need photo enhancements

## Cross-Workflow Insurance Gaps

These gaps span multiple workflows and represent systemic insurance documentation issues.

### **CROSS-GAP 1: No Photo Continuity Across Workflows**

**Issue:** Photos captured in Install, Demo, Check Service, and Pull are not systematically linked.

**Insurance Impact:** Cannot easily prove the progression from damage → mitigation → drying → completion.

**Question for You:** Should we implement a "tracked materials" system that follows specific materials across all workflows?

**Example:**
- Install: "Master Bedroom - Carpet pad behind bed" = 35% moisture → Photo #1
- Check Service Visit 1: Same spot = 28% moisture → Photo #2
- Check Service Visit 3: Same spot = 18% moisture → Photo #3
- Pull: Same spot = 11% moisture (DRY) → Photo #4
- **Final Report:** Side-by-side comparison showing 35% → 11% with all photos

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Implement tracked materials system with photo continuity
- [ ] NO - Too complex for field operations
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for materials starting >25% moisture
- [ ] UNSURE - Need to see how it would work in practice

**If YES, how should we mark materials for tracking?**
- [ ] Physical labels/stickers with numbers
- [ ] Photo reference system (tech matches photo angle from Install)
- [ ] Detailed written descriptions ("2 inches above baseboard, left of door")
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

---

### **CROSS-GAP 2: No Auto-Generated Insurance Report Package**

**Issue:** Data exists in 4 separate workflows, but no comprehensive insurance report is generated.

**Insurance Impact:** PSM/office staff must manually compile photos and data for adjusters (time-consuming, error-prone).

**Question for You:** Should we auto-generate an insurance report package?

**Proposed Report Package:**
1. **Initial Inspection Report** (from Install workflow) - ✅ Already exists
2. **Daily Monitoring Reports** (from Check Service workflow) - ❌ Missing
3. **Demo Completion Report** (from Demo workflow) - ❌ Missing
4. **Final Completion Report** (from Pull workflow) - ❌ Missing
5. **Comprehensive Photo Gallery** (all photos organized by room/date) - ⚠️ Exists but not formatted for insurance

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Auto-generate all 5 reports

### **CROSS-GAP 3: No Thermal Imaging Continuity**

**Issue:** Thermal imaging (if used) is captured in Install, but no follow-up thermal imaging in Pull to show before-after.

**Insurance Impact:** Cannot prove hidden moisture is gone (thermal imaging carries significant weight with adjusters).

**Question for You:** If thermal imaging is used on Install, should it be repeated on Pull?

- [ ] YES - Always repeat thermal imaging on Pull for before-after comparison
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if initial thermal imaging showed significant hidden moisture
- [ ] NO - One-time thermal imaging on Install is sufficient
- [ ] SKIP - We don't use thermal imaging

### **CROSS-GAP 4: No Centralized Timeline View**

**Issue:** Job data spans 4 workflows over multiple days/weeks, but no visual timeline for customer/insurance.

**Insurance Impact:** Difficult to demonstrate rapid response, continuous mitigation, and job duration.

**Question for You:** Should we create a visual job timeline?

**Example Timeline:**
- Day 1: Install workflow (3:45 PM - 7:20 PM) - [Photos]
- Day 2: Check Service (11:00 AM - 11:30 AM) - [Photos + Readings]
- Day 3: Check Service (10:15 AM - 10:45 AM) - [Photos + Readings]
- Day 4: Demo workflow (8:00 AM - 2:30 PM) - [Photos]
- Day 5: Check Service (11:30 AM - 12:00 PM) - [Photos + Readings]
- Day 7: Pull workflow (9:00 AM - 11:15 AM) - [Photos]

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Visual timeline with photos/data at each point
- [ ] NO - Not necessary
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only for jobs >5 days duration
- [ ] UNSURE - Need to see example

### **CROSS-GAP 5: No Equipment Rental Duration Proof**

**Issue:** Equipment placed in Install, checked in Check Service, removed in Pull - but no consolidated proof of rental duration.

**Insurance Impact:** Insurance disputes rental duration (claims equipment wasn't needed for X days).

**Question for You:** Should we auto-generate an equipment rental summary?

**Proposed Equipment Rental Report:**
- Dehumidifier #12345: Placed 11/1 at 3:45 PM → Removed 11/8 at 10:30 AM = 6.9 days
- Runtime hours: 162 hours (photos showing 0 hours on install, 162 hours on pull)
- Daily checks: 6 visits with runtime photos showing continuous operation
- Before-after moisture: 32% → 12% (dry standard achieved)

**Your Input:**
- [ ] YES - Auto-generate equipment rental report
- [ ] NO - Invoice is sufficient
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Only if insurance requests proof
- [ ] UNSURE

## Questions for Review

Please review all sections above and provide your feedback. Below are summary questions to guide your review:

### Overall Workflow Strategy

**Q1:** Are you satisfied with the 4-workflow structure (Install, Demo, Check Service, Pull)?
- [ ] YES - Keep as-is
- [ ] NO - Needs restructuring (explain below)
- [ ] PARTIAL - Some workflows should be combined/split (explain below)

**Your notes:** _________________________________________________________________

---

**Q2:** Should certain workflows be optional or always required?
- Install: ☐ Always required ☐ Optional
- Demo: ☐ Always required ☐ Optional (only if demo work needed)
- Check Service: ☐ Always required ☐ Optional ☐ Required until moisture targets met
- Pull: ☐ Always required ☐ Optional

---

**Q3:** What is your biggest concern about adding photo requirements?
- [ ] Tech adoption (field staff won't comply)
- [ ] Time per job (too many photos slows down service)
- [ ] Storage costs (photos consume cloud storage)
- [ ] Complexity (too many steps/requirements)
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

---

### Photo Documentation Strategy

**Q4:** Overall, should we prioritize MORE photos or BETTER photos?
- [ ] MORE - Quantity matters for insurance (capture everything)
- [ ] BETTER - Quality over quantity (fewer, more strategic photos)
- [ ] BALANCED - Set minimums but encourage comprehensive documentation

---

**Q5:** Should we implement mandatory photo minimums per workflow?
- Install minimum: ______ photos (or leave optional)
- Demo minimum: ______ photos (or leave optional)
- Check Service minimum: ______ photos (or leave optional)
- Pull minimum: ______ photos (or leave optional)

---

**Q6:** Which photo enhancements would you implement FIRST (top 3)?
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

### Insurance Reporting

**Q7:** Would auto-generated insurance reports save PSM time and improve claim approval rates?
- [ ] YES - Absolutely, this is critical
- [ ] PROBABLY - Worth exploring
- [ ] NO - Manual reports are fine
- [ ] UNSURE - Need to see examples first

---

**Q8:** What's your biggest insurance claim challenge that better documentation could solve?
- [ ] Claim denials (pre-existing damage disputes)
- [ ] Claim reductions (scope of work disputes)
- [ ] Slow adjuster approvals (insufficient documentation)
- [ ] Equipment rental disputes (duration or necessity)
- [ ] Customer disputes (billing or completion)
- [ ] Other: _________________________________
