## LOGO GUIDELINES

### Logo Usage

The Entrusted logo must appear in **white or black** when paired with background colors that are not within the Entrusted color palette. This maintains clarity and contrast, preserving the logo's integrity across all applications.

### Logo Placement Rules

- The orange "E" element should **never** appear on black or dark gray backgrounds
- The **only approved backgrounds** for the "E" element are white or light gray
- Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height/width of the stylized "E"
- The custom "E" may be used as a design accent but **must always be accompanied by the full Entrusted logo**

### Logo Misuse — Do NOT:

- ❌ Recolor the logo
- ❌ Distort vertically or horizontally
- ❌ Use in unauthorized positions
- ❌ Use unauthorized colors
- ❌ Apply effects or gradients
- ❌ Crop the logo
- ❌ Use at too small a size (minimum 40px height)
- ❌ Use with dark backgrounds
